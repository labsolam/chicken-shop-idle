# Strategy Research: Analysis of 10 Idle Games

**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Purpose:** Research and analyze mechanics from 10 successful idle games to inform Chicken Shop Idle design.

---

## 1. Egg, Inc.

**Theme:** Chicken farm / egg production empire

### Core Loop
- Tap to hatch chickens -> chickens lay eggs -> eggs shipped by trucks -> earn money
- Money spent on research upgrades and habitat expansion
- Bottleneck system: trucks limit income even if egg production is high

### Key Mechanics
- **Research tree** (Common + Epic): Common resets on prestige, Epic is permanent (costs premium currency)
- **Vehicle upgrades:** Shipping capacity creates a secondary bottleneck players must manage
- **Egg tiers:** Progress through increasingly valuable egg types (Edible -> Superfood -> Medical -> etc.)
- **Contracts:** Time-limited co-op challenges for premium rewards

### Prestige System
- **Soul Eggs:** Earned proportional to total earnings before prestige. Each gives +10% earnings bonus
- **Prophecy Eggs:** Rare eggs that multiply Soul Egg bonus
- Prestige resets: farm population, common research, habitats, vehicles, egg type
- Prestige keeps: Epic Research, premium currency, Soul Eggs, artifacts

### What Works for Chicken Shop
- The chicken theme directly maps to our game
- Bottleneck management (trucks = selling capacity) is engaging
- Tiered egg types = tiered chicken products
- Soul Eggs as prestige currency is elegant and thematic

## 2. AdVenture Capitalist

**Theme:** Business empire from lemonade stand to oil company

### Core Loop
- Buy businesses -> businesses generate income over time -> reinvest profits
- Each business has a cycle time and payout amount
- Buying multiples of a business increases payout

### Key Mechanics
- **Managers:** Automate individual businesses (one-time purchase each)
- **Milestone unlocks:** At purchase thresholds (25, 50, 100, etc.), businesses get speed or profit multipliers
- **Cash upgrades:** Spend money for permanent multipliers on specific businesses
- **Multiple worlds:** Earth, Moon, Mars each with independent economies

### Prestige System
- **Angel Investors:** Earned proportional to lifetime earnings (square root formula)
- Each Angel gives +2% to all profits
- Angels can also be "sacrificed" (spent) on powerful upgrades
- Rule of thumb: reset when Angels gained >= current total Angels

### What Works for Chicken Shop
- Milestone unlocks at purchase thresholds create satisfying "breakpoints"
- Manager automation as purchasable upgrades
- Angel sacrifice mechanic (spend prestige currency for upgrades OR keep as multiplier)
- Simple, clean UI with progress bars for each business cycle

## 3. AdVenture Communist

**Theme:** Communist resource production state

### Core Loop
- Produce resources (potatoes, land, ore, etc.) using generators
- Higher-tier generators produce lower-tier generators
- Comrades (produced at a flat rate) are required alongside resources to buy generators

### Key Mechanics
- **Flat generator costs:** Unlike most idle games, buying more doesn't increase price
- **Comrade bottleneck:** Linear comrade production gates exponential resource growth
- **Researchers:** Cards that provide multipliers; can be upgraded by collecting duplicates
- **Rank missions:** Specific goals (produce X potatoes, own Y generators) to advance ranks
- **Events:** Weekly limited-time parallel games with unique reward structures

### Prestige System
- **Time Travel:** Resets everything but keeps all researched technologies from past runs
- Should only be done when progression becomes very slow
- Technologies compound across resets

### What Works for Chicken Shop
- Mission/rank system gives clear short-term goals
- Researcher card system (collect duplicates to upgrade) adds collection mechanic
- Comrade-style bottleneck (e.g., "staff" as a secondary resource) prevents pure exponential blowout
- Events keep long-term players engaged

## 4. Cookie Clicker

**Theme:** Baking cookies at cosmic scale

### Core Loop
- Click to bake cookies -> buy buildings that auto-produce cookies -> buy upgrades
- Buildings: Cursor, Grandma, Farm, Mine, Factory... up to cosmic-scale producers
- Each building type has synergy upgrades with other buildings

### Key Mechanics
- **Golden Cookies:** Random clickable bonuses (Frenzy, Lucky, Click Frenzy, etc.)
- **Wrinklers:** Absorb cookie production but return 1.1x when popped (net gain for idle)
- **Sugar Lumps:** Very slow resource (1 per ~24 hours) used to level up buildings
- **Minigames:** Garden (plant combinations), Stock Market (buy/sell), Pantheon (god buffs)
- **Seasons:** Easter, Christmas, Valentine's, Halloween each add collectible upgrades

### Prestige System (Ascension)
- **Heavenly Chips:** Earned based on total cookies baked (all time), formula uses square root
- **Prestige Levels:** Each adds +1% CPS permanently
- **Heavenly Upgrades:** Spend chips on permanent perks (persistent upgrade slots, dragon, etc.)
- First ascension recommended at 200-300+ prestige levels for meaningful boost
- Later ascensions: aim to at least double prestige level each time

### What Works for Chicken Shop
- Heavenly upgrade tree gives meaningful prestige spending choices
- Permanent upgrade slots (carry specific upgrades through prestige)
- Sugar Lumps as ultra-slow resource for building levels
- Seasonal events for long-term engagement
- Wrinkler-style mechanic (sacrifice short-term for long-term gain)

## 5. Clicker Heroes

**Theme:** RPG monster slaying with heroes

### Core Loop
- Click/idle to deal damage to monsters -> earn gold -> level up heroes for more DPS
- Every 5 zones: boss fight with 30-second timer
- Heroes have abilities that can be activated for temporary boosts

### Key Mechanics
- **Hero leveling:** Each hero has base DPS, leveled up with gold
- **Gilding:** Random hero gilds give 50% DPS bonus, can be moved between heroes
- **Abilities:** Cooldown-based skills (Clickstorm, Powersurge, Lucky Strikes, etc.)
- **Dual playstyles:** Idle mode (no clicking) vs Active mode (click + abilities) with different optimal builds
- **Ancients:** Permanent upgrades purchased with Hero Souls after ascending

### Prestige System (Ascension + Transcension)
- **Ascension:** Earn Hero Souls (each = +10% DPS), spend on Ancients
- **Transcension (super-prestige):** Resets Ancients and Hero Souls, earns Ancient Souls
- Ancient Souls empower Outsiders (meta-progression layer on top of Ancients)
- Two-layer prestige creates very deep long-term progression

### What Works for Chicken Shop
- Two-layer prestige system (Ascension + Transcension) extends endgame significantly
- Idle vs Active mode distinction rewards different play patterns
- Gilding system (targeted bonuses on specific units)
- 30-second boss timer creates tension at progression walls

- **Excavations:** Dig for faction coins, artifacts, rubies (costs increase per dig)
- **Challenges:** Hidden-requirement goals that unlock faction-specific perks
- **Artifacts:** Powerful passive items from excavation

### Prestige System (Abdication + Reincarnation + Ascension)
- **Abdication (soft reset):** Quick reset for minor bonuses
- **Reincarnation:** Major reset at 1 octillion gems, provides Reincarnation Power
- **Ascension:** Even larger reset that fundamentally changes gameplay priorities
- **Ascension 4:** Endgame layer allowing cross-faction builds
- Three+ layers of prestige create enormous depth

### What Works for Chicken Shop

- Multi-layer prestige with each layer changing gameplay priorities
- Hidden challenges for discovery and exploration

## 7. Idle Miner Tycoon

**Theme:** Mining empire with shaft/elevator/warehouse pipeline

### Core Loop

- Hire managers to automate each stage

### Key Mechanics
- **Three-stage pipeline:** Shaft -> Elevator -> Warehouse (must balance all three)
- **Boost milestones:** At levels 10, 25, 50, 100 each component gets 2x boost

## 8. NGU Idle

**Theme:** RPG-style idle with "Number Goes Up" philosophy

### Core Loop
- Allocate Energy/Magic resources across multiple systems (training, NGU, adventure, etc.)
- Fight through adventure zones for gear -> gear improves stats -> progress to next zone
- Beat titans at zone ends to unlock new game systems

### Key Mechanics
- **Resource allocation:** Energy and Magic split across Basic Training, Augments, NGU, etc.

## 9. Antimatter Dimensions

### Key Mechanics
